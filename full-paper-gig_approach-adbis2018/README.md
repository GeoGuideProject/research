# A Genericness, Interactivity and Guidance-based Approach for Spatiotemporal Data Applications

### What we want?

Build a (mini) survey of papers that can be useful.

1. What is the main focus of the approach?
2. Is it a generic approach?
3. Does it take into account temporal data?
4. Does it take into account other attributes besides spatial or temporal data?
